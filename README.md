# ImgPreProcessing_FPGA
This is a FPGA based solution for image pre-processing script used in Low-Cost-Celestial-Navigation project

While the current implementation of the image pre-processing sub-system is extremely time consumming and hard to adjust based on the image,
this project aims to provide an alternative implementation with faster processing speed, more plexible and low maintenance.

This project is initialized on 2/15/2019 by Jiankun Dong
The deliverables are:
  1. FPGA on board solution
  2. DataMemo for testing
  3. Report/reflection
